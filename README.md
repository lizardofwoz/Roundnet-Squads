Summary:

When your squad is matching, it can sometimes be difficult to determine what the possible pairings are, especially when pressured to do so quickly. This program solves that problem, by generating all the possible ways to match after the opposing team places.

The only required input is the opposing team’s 3 net pairings and your squad size. There are a few more optional fields that are useful in some scenarios. These are your squad’s pairings from the previous round (since you can’t have the same pair play together twice in a row), the player or players you’d like to sub this round, and the players that must play this round. Finally, there is an option to change the net variance (default is 3) as it may be necessary to increase it in some situations when there are no possible matchups in which the variance is 3 or less for each net.

How to use this program:

First enter the opposing team’s placements. Do this by typing the rankings of both players on each net, without spaces or separators. For example, Net 1: 14; Net 2: 63; Net 3: 27

Next, set your squad size (7 or 8).

When you are in round 2, 3, or 4, you’ll want to input your squad’s previous round pairings. Enter these in any order similarly to the above example. For example, if your #3 and #5 played together the previous round, enter 35, and so on.

You can enter the player(s) (up to 2) to sub this round. For example, to have #1 and #4 sub, enter 14. You can also enter the players (up to 6) that must play this round. For example, enter 1345 if you’d like those 4 players to play.

Interpreting the results:

After pressing the enter button, you will see all the possible matchups that your team can choose from. The nets are ordered in the same way as the opposing team’s nets from the input. So 13, 25, 47 means that #1 and #3 would play on net 1, and so on for nets 2 and 3. The player(s) to sub are also listed. If there are no results, you will see an error. To fix this, either remove some restrictions on subs and required players, or increase the variance by 1 if there are no legal options. To change the variance, check “Show other options” and type the new variance (e.g. 4).
